Learning a new programming language is best achieved by solving an actual problem. godi is the project I used to learn go and I will share the most exciting things about go that were revealed to me in the process. The speech will be held from the perspective of a go-beginner, showing aspects of the go language using actual code of godi.

**Ru-Go-La - It's not a salad !**

Rust is the up-and-coming systems programming language that promises safety without sacrificing performance. Go on the other hand already established itself as language for building "[simple, reliable and efficient software](http://golang.org/)".

The first part shall be a short Rust introduction, whereas the second one will show Rust's main language features using actual programs and compares them to the respective go implementation.

Topics we touch will be:

* The Borrow-Checker
* Polymorphism
* Concurrency Patterns
* C-Interop
* Standard Library and Thirdparty Libraries
* Performance and Efficiency
* Testing and Benchmarking
* Dependencies and Deployment
* Is explicit better than implicit ?
